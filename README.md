# Use Twilio To Send/Receive Message

>  **Want a America phone number? Register [Twilio](www.twilio.com/referral/EqL6Os) to get one!**

## How To

### Send

Run `./sendmsg.sh` and follows the hints. But first, change the constant `FROM, TO, BODY` to your own in sendmsg.sh.

If you want use `send.py`, please ensure the twilio libs installed first. If not, please run command `pip install twilio` to install it.

### Receive

I only have a trial number, so I cannot receive message through by this way. You can check [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/tutorials/how-to-receive-and-reply-node-js#teconsent) to know more details.
