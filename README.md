# Use Twilio To Send/Receive Message

## How To

### Send

Run `./sendmsg.sh` and follows the hints. But first, change the constant `FROM, TO, BODY` to your own in send.py and sendmsg.sh.

### Receive

I only have a trial number, so I cannot receive message through by this way. You can check [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/tutorials/how-to-receive-and-reply-node-js#teconsent) to know more details.
